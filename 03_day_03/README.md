# Day 3 – Conditional Statements & Logic


**Focus:** Conditional statements, comparison and logical operators, nested logic

## Main Concepts Covered

- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, etc.)
- Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- Nested conditionals

## Projects & Exercises

### Leap Year Checker
- **File:** `leap_year.py`
- Checks if a year is a leap year using nested conditionals
- Practices division and modulo operations

### Roller Coaster Project
- **Files:** 
  - `roller_cooster.html` – Web version
  - `roller_coster_by_GPT.py` – AI-assisted version
  - `roller_coster_ride.py` – Main implementation
- Simulates a roller coaster ticketing system:
  - Age-based ticket pricing
  - Optional photo add-on
  - User input handling
  - Multiple conditional checks

## Key Learning Outcomes

- Understanding conditional flow control
- Building and combining complex decision trees
- Real-world application of logic statements

## Skills Developed

- Problem-solving with conditionals
- Input validation
- Organizing and structuring code
- Debugging logical errors
