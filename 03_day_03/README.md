# Day 3: Conditional Statements & Logic

## Main Concepts Covered
- Conditional statements (if, elif, else)
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators (and, or, not)
- Nested conditionals

## Projects & Exercises

### Leap Year Checker
**File:** `leap_year.py`
- Determines if a given year is a leap year
- Uses nested conditional logic
- Practices division and modulo operations

### Roller Coaster Project
**Files:** 
- `roller_cooster.html` - Web interface version
- `roller_coster_by_GPT.py` - AI-assisted version
- `roller_coster_ride.py` - Main implementation

A comprehensive project that simulates a roller coaster ticket system:
- Age-based ticket pricing
- Photo add-on options
- Multiple conditional checks
- User input handling

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Understanding conditional flow control
- Building complex decision trees
- Combining multiple conditions
- Real-world application of logic statements

## Skills Developed
- Problem-solving with conditional logic
- User input validation
- Code organization and structure
- Debugging logical errors
