# Day 7 – Hangman Game Project

**Focus:** Building Hangman using Python – Step-by-step Modular Implementation

## Main Concepts Covered

- Project decomposition: breaking a game into logical steps
- Program state and variable management
- String manipulation and list indexing for game logic
- Using separate files for game art and word lists
- Updating and displaying game progress visually

## Projects & Files

- **01_hangman_01.py:** Basic game setup and initial guess logic
- **02_hangman_02.py:** Improved guessing and state update
- **03_hangman_03.py:** Adding win/loss conditions
- **04_hangman_04.py:** Multiple incorrect guesses and feedback
- **05_hangman_05_final.py:** Final, complete Hangman implementation
- **hangman_art.py:** Contains ASCII art for hangman visuals
- **hangman_words.py:** List of words used in the game

## Key Learning Outcomes

- Incremental program development for complex problems
- Managing user input, loops, and conditionals in a real project
- Visualizing and debugging program state
- Code organization across multiple files

## Skills Developed

- Building complete projects from smaller steps
- Handling lists, strings, and game logic in Python
- Organizing code for reusability and clarity
