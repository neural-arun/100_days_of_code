# **Day 10: Functions with Outputs and Calculator Project** ðŸ§®

â€¢ Mastered functions with return values and learned how to create modular, reusable code components that can output data
â€¢ Built multiple versions of a calculator application (`03_calculator01.py`, `04_calculator_02.py`, `05_calculator03.py`) progressing from basic operations to advanced functionality
â€¢ Explored recursion concepts and documented key principles in both markdown and PDF format for future reference

**Key Files:**
- `01.py` - Functions with outputs and string formatting
- `02_days_in_months.py` - Practical function implementation for date calculations
- `03-05_calculator*.py` - Progressive calculator development showcasing function evolution
- `06_recursion.md` & `06_recursion.pdf` - Comprehensive recursion study materials
- `art.py` - ASCII art for enhanced user interface

*Keep building! Functions are the foundation of clean, maintainable code! ðŸš€*
