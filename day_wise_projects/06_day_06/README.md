# Day 6 â€“ Functions & Reusability


**Focus:** Writing Functions, Arguments, Return Values, and Reusable Code

## Main Concepts Covered

- Defining functions with `def`
- Passing arguments (positional and keyword)
- Using return values to output results
- Importance of indentation and function scope
- Writing reusable and modular code

## Projects & Exercises

- **functions_basics.py:** Creating simple functions and printing outputs
- **prime_checker.py:** Function to check if a number is prime
- **paint_calculator.py:** Calculates the amount of paint needed for a wall using a function
- **caesar_cipher.py:** Implements the Caesar Cipher for basic text encryption and decryption
- **ceasar_cipher_by_AI.py:** AI-assisted implementation of the cipher (if present)
- Additional function practice: factorial, sum of numbers, etc.

## Key Learning Outcomes

- Understanding how and why to use functions
- Using parameters and arguments for flexibility
- Building real-world utilities with functions
- Improving code organization and reusability

## Skills Developed

- Clean, readable, and maintainable code structure
- Breaking down complex logic into manageable pieces
- Laying groundwork for functional and modular programming
