# Day 9 â€“ Dictionaries and Secret Auction Project

**Focus:** Python Dictionaries, Key-Value Pairs, and Building a Secret Auction App

## Main Concepts Covered

- Creating and using dictionaries in Python
- Storing and updating key-value data
- Iterating over dictionary items
- Nested dictionaries for more structured data
- Using functions with dictionaries as arguments

## Projects & Files

- **dictionaries_basics.py:** Practice with dictionary creation, access, update, and loops
- **nesting.py:** Working with nested lists and dictionaries
- **secret_auction.py:** Simple CLI project for running a secret auction using dictionary logic
- **secret_auction_by_AI.py:** AI-assisted extension of the secret auction project (if present)

## Key Learning Outcomes

- Managing structured data with dictionaries
- Building projects that require mapping names/keys to values
- Combining user input with dictionary mechanics for interactivity

## Skills Developed

- Efficient data lookup and mutation
- Organizing data for small projects and real-world simulations
- Collaborating multiple concepts: input, loops, and data structures
