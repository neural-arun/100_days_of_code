# Day 5 â€“ For Loops & Password Generator

**Date:** September 6, 2025  
**Focus:** Python For Loops, Aggregation Patterns, and Password Generation

## Main Concepts Covered

- Using `for` loops to iterate over lists and ranges
- Calculating sums, averages, and other aggregates in loops
- Practicing classic loop challenges (FizzBuzz, even sums, etc.)
- Understanding loop control and range usage
- Building password generators with varying difficulty

## Projects & Exercises

- **for_loop.py:** Practice with for loops over data
- **avg_height.py:** Calculate average student height using a loop
- **highest_score.py:** Find the highest score in a list with a loop
- **sum_till_100.py:** Sum all numbers from 1 to 100
- **even_sum.py:** Sum all even numbers within a range
- **fizzBuzz_game.py:** Classic FizzBuzz coding problem
- **pypassword_generator_easy_level.py:** Simple password generator using random characters
- **pypassword_generator_hard_level.py:** Advanced password generator with shuffle and randomization

## Key Learning Outcomes

- Fluency with for loops and range objects
- Aggregation logic and pattern recognition
- Building logic for data analysis problems
- Basic randomization in string/password generation

## Skills Developed

- Structured problem solving with loops
- Handling real-world data (scores, lists of values)
- Crafting utility scripts like password generators
- Improving accuracy and conciseness in code
