# 100 Days of Code Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code challenge repository! This is a personal journey to improve my programming skills through consistent daily practice.

## About This Repository

This repository documents my progress through the 100 Days of Code challenge, where I commit to coding for at least 1 hour every day for 100 consecutive days. Each day folder contains the work, exercises, and projects completed on that specific day.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Daily Practice**: Each numbered folder (01_day_01, 02_day_02, etc.) contains the code and exercises for that specific day
- **Learning Progress**: Gradual progression from basic concepts to more advanced topics
- **Project Code**: Python scripts, HTML files, and other programming exercises
- **Notes**: Key learnings and insights from each day (in the 00_notes folder)
